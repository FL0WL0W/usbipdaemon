# usbipdaemon
Windows service that automatically attaches any usb device from usbip server.

<p>
  Released version under <a href="https://github.com/FL0WL0W/usbipdaemon/tree/main/usbipdaemon/bin/Release">usbipdaemon/bin/Release</a><br/>
  Set IP of usbip server in usbipdaemon.exe.config. multiple servers can be listed with IPs seperated by spaces.<br/>
  Install as windows service using install.bat as administrator<br/>
  <br/>
  I included the usbip.exe in the Debug and Release folders. I am probably not going to keep up with this so you may need to update usbip.exe to the latest one from https://github.com/cezanne/usbip-win/releases<br/>
  <br/>
  I also included usbipd.txt which shows the setup of the raspberry pi to automatically attach any usb device.<br/>
