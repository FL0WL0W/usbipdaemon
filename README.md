# usbipdaemon
Windows service that automatically attaches any usb device from usbip server

<p>
  released version under /bin/Release<br/>
  set ip of usbip server in usbipdaemon.exe.config. multiple servers can be listed with ips seperated by spaces<br/>
  install as windows service<br/>
  
  <br/>I included the usbip.exe in the Debug and Release folders. I am probably not going to keep up with this so you may need to update usbip.exe to the latest one from https://github.com/cezanne/usbip-win/releases
