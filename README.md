# usbipdaemon
Windows service that automatically attaches any usb device from usbip server

<p>
  released version under usbipdaemon/bin/Release<br/>
  set ip of usbip server in usbipdaemon.exe.config. multiple servers can be listed with ips seperated by spaces<br/>
  install as windows service using install.bat<br/>
  <br/>
  I included the usbip.exe in the Debug and Release folders. I am probably not going to keep up with this so you may need to update usbip.exe to the latest one from https://github.com/cezanne/usbip-win/releases<br/>
  <br/>
  I also included usbipd.txt which shows the setup of the raspberry pi to automatically attach any usb device<br/>
